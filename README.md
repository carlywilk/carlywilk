# Hi, I'm Carly!

### Welcome to my GitHub Page âœ¨
As a software developer with a background in biology and sociology, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise that has shaped my ability to think critically, pay attention to detail, and quickly adapt to new challenges. In addition to these skills, my professional and personal experiences have made equity-seeking and intersectional perspectives a cornerstone of my work, fostering connections grounded in care and consent.
